okay . the boy is standing on a stool . it is tilting over . he is reaching for cookies in the cookie jar . and his sister is standing side him reaching up for some of the cookies . and the mother is standing right near them washing dishes in the sink . and the water is running into the sink and the sink is flooding over with water . and  ... you want scenery description or anything like that ? okay yeah . outside the window where the mother is there is a walkway it looks like it is going out to a garage . and also one is on his kitchen sink area there is like a coffee cup two cups and a plate . and  ... hey okay . and I did say the stool is tilting  //.,0
the boy is giving his sister a cookie . and the stool is about to fall . and the mothers drying dishes . and the waters coming out of the faucet . and the waters overflowing out of the sink onto the floor . and the little girl is putting her hand up to her mouth to signal not to say anything so the mother will not know about it . that is all .,0
"okay . mothers washing the dishes . the sink is overflowing with water . the child is falling off the stool as he gets cookies out of the cookie jar . the daughter is asking for her share . the curtains are probably blowing . the winds probably blowing . the windows open and the curtains are blowing . she is getting her feet wet . she is wiping the dishes , drying the dishes . that is about it .",0

I observed that one of the two slippers that the girl is wearing looks as if its sole the left one is thicker than the right . the woman is letting the sink run over . the water is running full tilt and overflowing the sink . she is drying a plate and she has a towel in her right hand and it looks as if she has something else . no that is the end of the curtain that is behind the plate in her left hand . she has her left side to the window . she is already dried a plate and two cups . the window is open and you can see the path outside going around to the left of the back of the house . and another room in the house the window is also open I believe . the woman is standing with her foot in the water but not where the water is not running out of her but it is splash up and her right shoe is in the puddle . and that is what I see . and a kitchen .,0
okay . let me see . the boy is getting cookies out of the cookie jar . and the stool is just about to fall over . the little girl is reaching up for a cookie . and the mother is drying dishes . the water is running in to the sink and the sink is running over onto the floor . you want action ? you want all the action there is ? anyhow I think that is all the action there is . and that little girl is laughing . that little girl . did I say the mother was drying dishes ? drying a dish .,0

the boy is on a stool that is falling while he is trying to get some cookies out of the cookie jar in the top shelf of the cupboard . the little girl is reaching for a cookie . it looks like she is sort of laughing at the boy or putting her finger up to her mouth to be quiet so her mother does not hear who is in the kitchen drying dishes but the water in the sink is overflowing onto the floor and she is stepping in the water . the window is open . looks like it is summer outside . yeah there is trees with leaves . is that all you want me to do ? does not look it is like she hears them . she does not seem to be aware of them . some of the dishes are already washed and dried . is that all you want me to say ?,0
well the boy is handing the girl cookies and she is telling him to be quiet I guess . he is going to fall . the mother is drying dishes just is oblivious to the water coming out all over the place . the dishes . that is the action ? okay that is the only action I can see . water running and the mother and the kids taking the cookies .,0
"does not matter where you start then right ? alright . there is a little boy on a step stool which is tilted and he is getting some cookies . now do you want descriptive as far as the cookie lids or how they are or just the actions  /? just the action . okay and looks like he is trying to hand a cookie to his sister . she kind of has her finger up towards her mouth or something like she might be giggling . the mothers drying dishes but the water is overflowing onto the floor . I do not know , the sink looks like it is almost tilted . now we should call the cup and the saucers . that is not action right is it ? the breeze might be blowing . the curtains look like they might be  ... any other action . I do not see anything else . I just see into the outdoors but I do not see anything moving . that is about it I guess . .",0
look at the picture ? oh okay . the boy is on the stool getting cookies from the cookie jar and giving them to the girl but the stool is about ready to tip over . the mother is drying the dishes as the sink faucet has filled the sink bowl and is running over onto the floor . that is all the action . let us see .,0
mhm . the mother is washing the dishes but not very attentively allowing the sink to overflow onto the floor . and she is drying a dish . kids are trying to get into the cookie jar . they have managed to get into it . the boy is standing on a stool which is in the process of falling over while he is trying to hand a cookie to his younger sister who is reaching for it . the window is open overlooking a garden . the wind is blowing slightly . it is ruffling the curtains . it is summer . or at least the grass is out and the trees are in leaf and the bushes . that is all of the action I see .,0
he is falling off the stool . the waters over flowing . not do you more ? is there more ? right there . what if . the action . I do not know what you strictly mean by action . the guys eating some cookies . is that action ? washing dishes ? is that action ? and the water coming out of the faucet is action . and drying the dishes is action . and taking the cookie is action . and I do not see anybody eating one . okay ? that is about all the action I see . any more ?,0
there is a girl waiting to get a cookie from I guess her brother . the stool tipping over where he is into the cookie jar in the cupboard . womans washing dishes . sinks overflowing . windows open . where the kids into the cookie jar the lids off of course . I do not know whether the curtains are blowing or not . these are the action things you want right ? no I do not see anything else . what did I miss ?,0
okay the sinks running over . the kids on a stool and is falling over . she is standing in the water . I would say that is about it . oh no there is something  ... no it as not writing upside down here . it looks like it . no that is all .,0
the scene is in the kitchen . the mother is wiping dishes and the water is running on the floor . a boy is trying to get cookies out of a jar and he is about to tip over on a stool . the little girl is reacting to his falling . it seems to be summer out . the window is open . the curtains are blowing . it must be a gentle breeze . there is grass outside in the garden . mothers finished certain of the dishes . kitchens very tidy . the mother seems to have nothing in the house to eat except cookies in the cookie jar . the children look to be almost about the same size . perhaps they are twins . they are dressed for summer warm weather . you want more ? the mothers in a short sleeve dress . I will hafta say it is warm .,0
well let us see . we have the water coming out of the spigot and the sink is stopped up and the water is going on the floor . apparently the mother is drying a dish . we have the boy standing on a stool trying to get cookies out of the cookie jar and handing them to his sister probably . and he is about to fall as the stool is tipping over . and the grass is growing probably . but I guess that is about the action .,0
"okay . water running out of the sink . lady drying a plate . and a child getting cookies out of the cookie jar standing on a stool that is tipping over . and a little girl reaching up for a cookie . and curtains at the window . a path outside . a tree . a window into another room . shrubbery . grass . let us get back to the room again . there is two cups and a plate sitting on the counter top . cupboard . the lady has a apron on , dress , slippers . and the boy has on a short sleeve shirt , short pants , socks , and shoes . little girl has on a dress , socks , strap slippers . did I mention everything ? sink . faucet with water running out of it . an open window behind the sink . tie back curtains . and that is all I see .",0
"young boy is up at the cookie jar . he has the cookie jar opened . he is reaching for one for himself . he is handing one down to his sister . the three legged stool is coming down with him . they are nicely dressed kids but the boy needs his socks pulled up . that is all I see there . I presume it is mother is at the sink . the water is running over out of sink . she is drying a dish . she is looking out the window . there are two cups and a dish , I presume that is a dish , that are already dry I guess and sitting on the side of the sink . nicely groomed . nice curtains pulled back . it is apparently summer outside because the windows open and it looks like shrubs are growing . you can see a window in the other part of the house . I presume that is still their house . and there is a driveway bordered with grass . and there is a tree out there somewhere that you can see part of the trunk and part of the foliage . and I see cabinets around the kitchen , other cabinets . and that is about it .",0
well the girl is watching the boy go into the cookie jar . he has a cookie in his hand . he is on the stool . the stool is falling . the mother is drying dishes . has a plate in her hand . sink is overflowing . there is water on the floor . she is stepping in the water . something that is going on you said ? the little girl looks like she is motioning to the boy to be quiet . and I do not know what else . the womans looking out the window . the windows open .,0
there hasta be action . oh the boy is falling off the stool . the lady is drying dishes . the water is running out of the sink . I do not know what else they would want . that is about all I can see . those three things .,0
mhm . the little boy is reaching for a cookie . and he is falling at the same time because the stool has tipped over . his little sister is reaching for a cookie and I think beginning to laugh because he is falling . the sink is running over and dripping water on the floor while the mother is trying to dry the dishes . the window is open and the curtains are blowing in the breeze coming in from outside . the water is running in the sink . that is why it is overflowing . I also believe that the mother is daydreaming . possibly worrying about something . that is it . that is all I see .,0
the mother is washing the dishes . the children are getting into the cookie jar . the little girl has a finger on her lip as though trying to silence the boy who is the culprit who is  //. he is up on a stool which is going to upset . the mother is so busy I do not know what she is doing that she does not know how the the water in the sink to overflow . it is down on the floor . she is going to be disturbed by it . maybe she had been looking outside . I do not know . the window is up . she has a nice view of a outside . there is a little yard and a path and the shrubbery and the tree out there . and there is some dishes already wiped evidently and put up on the sink . it is a square kitchen . now in the sink and then the others . along one side in the cupboard . along the other side is the boy on that cupboard . is that enough ?,0
"okay . the mothers washing the dishes and the sink is overflowing . she has some of them dried already on the side as she is looking out the window while the little boy is falling off the stool because he is getting into the cookie jar to give to his little sister who is reaching up to get the cookie also . there is water all over the floor . the garden is outside and the mothers not paying any attention to what they do . the stool is tipping . the door is open . there may be a little breeze coming in because this window is open . the little girl has her finger to her mouth  ""/. shh we will not tell mother while you give me the cookie . it is in the kitchen of course and two cups and a dish already have been dried . and the mothers stepping in the water and she is probably so engrossed in what she is doing outside she neither knows what the children are doing nor is she paying any attention that the waters overflowing .",0
you mean starting from say left to right or whatever ? the brother or the boy is reaching into the cookie jar . and the sister could be laughing or cautioning him . and the stool is tipping over . and old mom is standing in a puddle drying dishes . and the sink is overflowing . and the perspective means the path is coming right in the house . and what else do you want ? well the mom is drying the dishes . she is getting her feet wet . and the sisters reaching for the cookie that is in the brothers hand or the kids hand . yep .,0
well the kids stealing cookies out of the jar and on a stool that is tilted over . and his sisters waiting for him to hand her a cookie or  ... the mother is looking out the window and the dishes are being washed but the waters overrunning in the sink . and I would say that is about it .,0
there is a lady washing dishes and a kid getting in the cookie jar . and it is falling off the stool . and a girl reaching for cookies . and the water overflowing . and that is about it that I see of action .,0
"oh I was . oh this is gonna be like looking at those artistic things and fiddling when we get there . at her x@n is overflowing on the floor because the faucet is running . and she is standing in it . yet her kiddos are robbing the cookie jar and the little boy is falling off of the stool . he is getting some cookies though . and the girl does not have hers yet . I do not think the perspective on the corners quite right in the room . you wanna know how many dishes ? there are two cups and a plate on the counter . and she is drying a plate . and you know curtains on the windows are tied back . and a real pretty view out the window . you see a wing of the house , the living room and the path around the house . and the landscaping is bushes up close and happy evergreens and stuff . outside there is grass on the ground and there is a tree in at these hedges . yeah there is  /. he is getting cookies out of the cookie jar and he is falling off the stool . he is got two cookies already . he is giving one to his sister and he is gonna have one . and then even if he falls he is gonna have his cookies . she has her finger up to her mouth . I do not know whether she is saying sh@o or I want one too . I do not know how the mother can be so unaware !",0
oh there is a little boy on a step stool about to fall . he is reaching in the cookie jar . and the little girl reaching for a cookie . and the mother washing dishes . and the sink is overflowing . and the tap waters coming in . and it looks like there might be a breeze blowing the curtains . because the waters running on the floor .  ... and the door of the cupboard is ajar where he has a cookie jar .,0
real action . okay . reaching with an arm is that considered action ? okay reaching with an arm . finger on the face . the girl . cookie leaving the cookie jar . boy with cookie in each hand . standing on stool . but the stool about to fall over . let us go to mother . the mother drying dishes . water overflowing onto the floor . action . well she is drying dishes . I did say that . the windows open . but that is not action . the curtains are blowing . let us say the curtain is blowing . that is it . it is how you define action I guess .,0

it is a sunny day because the windows open . this is the interpreted one . okay then the little boy is reaching up to get a cookie and he is about to fall off the stool . and the waters overflowing in the sink . and the mother is drying the dishes but she does not see the water flowing over the  //. obviously she is just spaced out somewhere because she does not know that the boys getting the cookies and she does not know the waters overflowing in the sink and even she is standing in it . the little girl has her finger on her mouth so she is telling the little boy to be quiet and not let mother know that we are getting the cookies out of the cookie jar . and I would say mothers in some kind of a depression or something . just not with it .,0
there is a child reaching for a cookie . the stool is tilted . the girl is possibly moving her finger towards her mouth and reaching for a cookie . waters running out of the sink . the mothers drying dishes . somebodys gonna be screaming when the kid falls .

what do I tell you when I see it ? as I see it ? is there something going on here or  ..? oh it is just  ... well the first bad thing I see is the water running out of the sink running over . and the little boy up stealing cookies and giving one to his sister . and mamas drying the dishes and standing in the water . she is looking the other direction . and the little boys falling off the stool standing up on to get the cookie . he is gonna get hurt when he hits that sink . like an airplane going crazy . hmhunh no . you can see out the window out into the yard . and you can see a window over there on the other side of the house .,0
well the mothers washing the dishes . and the boy is reaching for cookies and he is falling off the stool . and the little girls laughing at him I think . and the waters spilling over onto the floor . . I cannot see any other action . I guess she is drying her dishes not washing them . she is doing something with them .,0
children are getting into the cookie jar . the little boy who is on the stool is about to fall because the stool is going to topple over . the mother has her back turned and is drying the dishes but the sink is full of water and the waters beginning to spill over onto the floor . sink is in front of a window . one can look out the window and see a path and what is obviously a yard . there is a plate and two cups or dishes on the counter . the children getting into the cookie jar there is one boy and one girl . the cookie jar is labelled Cookie jar . the cupboard door is open . there are curtains at the kitchen window . the mother is wearing an apron . she has a sleeveless dress and short hair . the little girl has straps on her shoes . the stool is a three legged stool .  ... that is about it .,0
the water is running out of the sink . and the kids falling off of the stool . he is stealing some cookies . and the little girl says do not tell your mother who is standing in the water and drying dishes . washing dishes I guess maybe drying them I do not know . and guess the waters splash all over the floor . that kid do not fall off that stool he is gonna break his neck . and getting the cookies . that is about all I can see .,0
"further right . oh there is a little girl reaching  ... oh let us say the little boys reaching for the cookie in the jar . and the stool is falling over . the little girls reaching up to the little boy for the cookie . and the mother apparently is washing the dishes and the water is running over . she is probably busy looking out at the garden . and the cups and the saucer are on the side . what else do you want ? things that I see ? you mean , curtains ? no I think that is about it .",0

I guess that is all the action . oh no the stool is tipping over . the stool that the boy is standing on is tipping over . that appears to be all the action . mhm .,1
"well , why what is she ? she is interested in something else and she does not realize that her water is spilling . and the children having a good time because while their mothers interested in something else they are stealing cookies . the boy looks like he is gonna be hurt . and oh the waters overflowing .

well the little boys in the cookie jar . and he is about to fall on the floor because the stool tilted . moms drying dishes . she is not paying attention because the sinks running over . waters all over the floor . the little girl I think is begging her brother to give her a cookie . I am not sure about that . must be summer time because the windows open . you can see the grass and shrubbery outside . and see a few dishes that mom has already dried .,1
well the kids up taking cookies out of the cookie jar . the other ones there holding her hand . the jar is gonna fall . she is washing dishes and forgot to turn the sink off . waters pouring all over the floor . dishes are on the sink . and it looks like a face laying in the yard the way the grass is . that is what we got . kid taking cookies out of the cookie jar . the kid has her hand up after it . mamas washing dishes . sinks running over . and that is it . good . windows open .,1
"the little boy is getting the cookie jar opened and is giving one to his sister I think .

. well a little boy is stealing cookies out of the cookie jar and giving some to his sister . and his stool is starting to fall so he is gonna fall . and the lady drying the dishes . and her sinks running over . suspect it is running and she did not turn it off and it is running over on the floor . she is drying dishes and watching out the window at the same time .,1
well the boys getting in the cookie jar . and he is standing on a stool that is falling over . and his sister maybe is telling him to be quiet so his mother will not see him . in the meantime the sink is running over on to the floor and she is drying dishes . and there is something going on outside the window . I do not know just what it is . she is drying dishes but I do not get the connection between the picture outside . I guess she is having her problems and they are having theirs .,1
"there is a little girl talking to this boy up on the stool . and she is asking him to bring some of this down or whatever it was a jar or whatever it is so it does not break . there is a mother over here . she is watching them that she has that break in her hand . and it looks like it is very strong or x@n or  ... she is looking real good at it , a jar or whatever . she is giving a little touch of her mouth . although that is . and it looks like he is gonna bring some of that down for them all . and mothers out there looking at them . and looks like she is washing this dishes that they already had it . and she is washing the dishes away from them . it looks that way . she is cleaning it you know .",1
"what is happening there ? oh my . poor kids . he is gonna fall off that cookie jar . we will start with the girl . she is going to receive a cookie . her brother is taking cookies out of a jar . and he got careless . and she is asking him for one . so he is handing one down to her . in the meantime he is getting ready to fall off of a stool , a three legged stool . and the mothers not paying much attention . she is looking out the window . and in looking out the window why she is letting her sink run over and the waters splash on the floor all over her . and what else ? the outside looks alright . they are doing more things on the outside . there is some more there . and then she is drying a dish . and she has two cups and a plate on the table . they have already eaten . well I did say she was letting the water run over the sink down onto the floor splash onto her feet . oh boy . then there is an angle here that is incomplete of the corner where the wall comes together . let us see what else should there be . oh let us see . there is a plate two cups . oh I did say she is letting the water run over the sink did not I ? yes . and she seems to be looking out the window while she is drying her dish . how about that ? does that have enough ?",1

I do not think I see anything else . okay .,1

I think so .,1
"well â€¡ the lady drying her dishes . the little boys up on a ladder reaching for cookie jar . and the little girls down on the floor reaching up toward him . then I see a sink , the dishes , cupboard . and then there is a walkway in the back .

I told you the water was running over and splash onto the floor . and the mother does not seem too too affected by it . she is drying a dish or wiping it . let us see . I guess the girl is laughing at her brother because he is going to fall . looks like a nice house . there is very little but I do not think that is meant for this . the corner that got to the corner . so this is a corner here . and that goes back into there but that is . do you see what I am making reference to ? the carpentry ?",1

well there is a boy trying to get some cookies from the cupboard . and then the little girl has her hand up for one . and there is a stool that is ready to fall that he is standing on . and there is a lady washing dishes and her sink is filled up full of water and it spilled all on the floor . she is standing by the window . . see the grass and the shrubbery outside . and two cups and a plate to be that is laying on the sink . I do not know if it is to be dried or what .,1
yeah she is spilling the water on the floor and he is falling off a seat or  ... the spigots going and he is reaching out for the cookies and she is reaching for the cookies and  ... she got the window open I guess . I do not know .,1

"okay Juniors in the cookie jar . and he is just about to go have himself an accident . his sisters standing down below waiting for a handful of cookies . and his moms drying the dishes I think . and she is having problems because the sinks running over and she is standing in a puddle of water , some empty dishes on the counter . as far as the action that is just about it .",1
"throat you want me to tell you ? the girl is talking to the boy . he is getting the cookie jar down . he has a cookie in his hand . he is falling off of his stool . the mothers doing the dishes and the waters running off into the floor . she is looking out the window apparently . I see grass and a lawn outside . and I see two bowls , cabinets . anything else I ? you want everything I can see ? I also see a cabinet door there . remember I said the water was overflowing  /. oh . . there is something inside here . okay .",1
oh anything I see . well there is a little girl here . she is pointing at something . and that looks like her brother is just about ready to fall down where she is sitting there where it says cookie jar . and here on her right side there is a young lady there . she is washing what she  ... she is cleaning  /. the  ... she is cleaning . what is she  //? she  ...,1
"read it to you ? well , the action . well the little boy has his hand in the cookie jar . and the little girl is begging for some of the cookies . and he is teetering on the stool where he climbed up . and mama is washing dishes , wiping them . and she is not watching what she is doing . and the water is overflowed on the floor . because she is watching out the window at the  ... am I going too fast ? looking at the beautiful lawn . where there is a garage and some bushes and of course grass and trees . and she is so immersed in that she has allowed the water to overflow on the floor . and she still has a couple of cups and a plate to wash . oh dear .",1
. can I look at it and tell you ? oh okay . well there is a girl and a boy and the boys in the cookie jar . and he is standing on a stool that is tipping over . and he is in the kitchen . and the mothers in the kitchen running the water at the sink . and the waters running over and it is all over the floor . and there are curtains at the windows . and there are cups and a plate on the pantry . and outside the window there is a path leading to a garage it looks like . and there are curtains there . and that is about all there .,1
now the boy standing on the stool is gonna fall . he is reaching for a cookie . he is handing a cookie to his sister I would imagine . poor mother was not very attentive and the water was x@n over the sink . oh boy . somethings missing and I do not know what it is . they have a nice backyard with a garage in the back and shrubbery . that is about it .,1
well the little boy is stealing cookies and giving it to his friend or sister . he is partially gonna fall off the stool . his sister is telling him to be quiet . the mother is washing dishes . and the water is overflowing onto the floor and she is standing in a puddle and has a smile on her face .,1
I see a little boy climbed up on a stool that is reaching for a cookie out of the cookie jar . the stool is about to fall . his sister is telling him to be very quiet . and also at the same time she is reaching for the cookie that he has in his hand . the mother is apparently washing or drying the dishes . and she has neglected to shut the water off and the sink is overflowing . I think that is all I see going on .,1
well the boy is in the cookie jar . and his sister is trying to take it from him . and he is on a stool going like this . and then there is a female over here with a plate in her hand that she is drying dishes . the water went overboard on this one on this sink . it is on the floor . and the boys getting cookies and his stool is wobbling . right here see .,1
"well I am seeing a lot of water that is not sposta be where it is . a full sink with more water running down all the way to the floor . a full sink with more water running down all the way to the floor . a full sink with more water running down all the way to the floor . a stool that is going to project somebody into a fall and real fast . getting out of the cookie jar . dishwashing and drying . and a girl trying to say silent so that they will not be caught . two cups and a plate that probably are dry and then the other plate is being dried . a cupboard door that is open . that stool though , I do not know what he is going to do with that . I do not know why the waters left on . it is gonna make a mess . she is drying the plate or the dishes or whatever it is that she is working on . and of course that cupboard door is open . if it had not been opened why maybe he would not have gotten his cookies . well otherwise it is except for the two accidents it is not too bad . but the boy has not gotten down to his fall yet . that is the way with boys you know .",1
mhm . well the kids is robbing a cookie jar . and the mother is washing dishes and forgetting that the water is running . it is running on the floor . and his stool is about to dump him . see here ? he is about to go . now I think that is just about all I can see that you might be looking for . he is about to drop off that stool too .,1
all the action ? okay it is a boy and a girl and their mom . and well they are falling down in through here . and then this here when the water it should be going down in there but it is going down on the side here . it is going all the way down in there . they are getting something to eat here . cookeiejar@k . and they are getting something to eat here . and this is a nice place what they have . but they put that stuff around in there . it looks nice . and then here when they had some stuff in through here . and  ... I like these things in through here too . yeah .,1
she is washing the dishes . and his stool is tilting . and he jar . cookie jar . and the waters overflowing on the floor . he handing the girl the cookies . she is drying the dishes . there is a cup and saucer and plate on the counter . hmhunh .,1
"oh boy . wowie the boys going up on a stool to get cookies and he is falling off the stool and his sister is just wondering about it . will he hit the bottom ? mama has a sink that is overrunning with water splash down onto her shoes . she is in the process of drying dishes . she is looking out an open window at the same time . the cookie jar is open . and the girl has her finger to her lips . well let me see . everything that is going to happen , huh ? looking out the window I do not know if it is the breeze blowing the curtains because over the window they look a little wee bit puffy . so maybe there is a slight breeze coming in the kitchen window . mamas drying the dishes and she forgetting herself and the water is overflowing from the sink down onto the floor splash into her shoes . alright there are two cups and a plate on the counter to the right of the sink . and well I did tell you the boy is getting ready to fall off of the stool . his sister is reaching up for a cookie , getting it from the cookie jar . so what else ? the door is open of course to get into the cupboard . doing . . three legged stool . I would venture to say that is it .",1
look this way ? well I really do not know because they have not gotten things turned up right . not in this one . maybe under this right here . it is like a  ... no it is not . looks like this is a kind of thing that whoever . she is cleaning . looking to see what they have so they can get it ready for bed I guess . I do not know . his hair is down . it is fallen down a lot .,1
okay he is falling off a stool . she is running the water over . cannot see anything else . no . okay . she is step in the water . no .,1
"stool is falling over . the little girl is criticizing her brother if it is her brother . her brothers getting in the cookie jar . and the stool gonna fall over with him . the mothers drying dishes . there is water . sinks overflowing . there is dirty dishes on the sink . there is curtains at the window . there is shrubbery , a tree outside . there is oh landscaping . you can see the window to the neighbor yard I guess her house . what else . anything else ? I did say that the waters running in the sink and overflowing and it is getting on the mothers shoe . she is standing in the water . she is drying a dish . she has an apron on . I told you the boys falling off the stool . and the girls trying to  ... cupboard door is open . the cookie jar is open . he is got a cookie in his hand he is handing to his sister I guess . you want any more things ? tie back curtains . I said some dishes on the counter . the waters running in the sink it is overflowing . and shows a garden in the neighbors house . tree growing in the neighbors yard . they have some shrubbery in their yard . I do not know .",1
mhm . there is a young boy going in a cookie jar . and there is a young girl . and I am saying he is a boy because it is hard to tell anymore . and he is in the cookie jar . and there is a stool that he is on and it already is starting to fall over . and so is the water in the sink is overflowing in the sink . I do not know about this hickey here whether that is more than what I said . like the mother is near the girl . and she has  /. oh I cannot think of the  ... she has the she is trying to wipe dishes . oh and stop the water from going out .,1
okay well the little boy is taking some cookies when his mothers not looking and is going to fall off the stool because it is tipping over . and the little girl is saying sh@o as she reaches up for a cookie . and pretty soon it is not gonna be very quiet . the mother is wiping the dishes as the sink is overflowing on the floor and she is walking in the water and apparently unconcerned . and the window is open . now as far as things happening I guess that is about it . she is wiping the dishes .,1
okay a child falling off a stool in the attempt to reach the cookie jar which it looks like he is knocked the lid off . and maybe he is gonna drop the cookie . and his girl friend is standing there beckoning him or reaching for the cookie that he is sposta give her . and the mother is not paying any attention to the kids . she is looking out the window and drying the dishes . at the same time she has let the sink run over and the water is cascading down on the floor and onto her feet . the curtains are waving and the window is open . and the yard looks like it is manicured . and other than the stool and the cabinets and the dishes that is all I can see .,1
"well this boy is almost falling off of the stool when he is putting up the picture . and she is washing dishes . I guess she would not know . oh my ! her sink is running over too is not it . is that all or is there more to it ? this one looks kind of like a  ... oh that is a plate I guess . and a cup and saucer . oh this is a lady here . is it or is not it ? right there . is that a lady ? when I had it this way it looked almost like a lady . oh . she is washing dishes . and she must have dropped one . oh no she let the sink ran over . and he is almost falling off of the stool . and she did something , it looks like .",1
"okay , I see a boy in the cookie jar . I see he has the lid off . I see that he is standing on a three legged stool and he is about to depart from that three legged stool . he has one cookie in his hand , handing it down to his sister and she is reaching up for it . and I think she is indicating to the boy to keep still so his mother does not hear what is going on . I see the mother . I guess she is drying the dishes and she is not paying attention because she is leaving the sink run over and it is spilling all over the floor . and she must not be conscious because she is standing in it and does not know it . I think she is probably looking out the window as I take the second look . and I see apparently a couple dirty dishes on the table top . I see the cupboard . I do not know whether they all have knob on them or not . does not look like the two where the boy and the girl are have knob on the cupboard door . and I see outside . I see apparently it is a tree , some shrubbery and some hedges . about it ?",1
alright . the little girl wants cookie . the boy is getting her one but he is going to fall off the stool . it is tilting . the mother is doing the dishes . and unfortunately the sink is overflowing on the floor . it is wet . . . the little  ... oh that is his feet . I thought there was something around the little boys foot or at least just one foot on top of the other . the little girl I do not whether she is laughing or asking for the cookie or saying shh so mother does not hear them .,1
the boys going into the cookie jar . and the mother is standing over here . cookie jar . the guys going into the cookie jar . mothers doing the dishes or just putting it on the table . I do not know . oh oop here . curtains . over here ? putting shoes on ? that is it . looks like water . cleaning dishes .,1

the boy is snitching cookies . the sisters laughing . the stool he is on is slanted . oh the water spilled over in the sink on to the floor . and there is dishes on the  ... she is drying a plate . curtains . a good view just  ... and the  ... well you can see I guess the backyard . and I do not know if that would be a part of the house or a garage or the walk .,1
okay . there are three persons in the kitchen . the little girl is instructing the little boy to take cookies out of the cookie jar on the second shelf of the cupboard . and at the same time his stool that he is standing on is about to collapse . the mother apparently is doing dishes and looking out the window . has the faucet on in the sink . and apparently the plug is in and the water is cascading over the kitchen floor . and it must be a warm sunny day because the window is open . and I can see the shrubbery and what appears to be the end of the house maybe a garage door . and on the counter there are dishes that the mother has either washed or has dried and is still washing a plate .,1
okay . well the little boy was looking at that cookie jar and he started to tip over . she was talking with him and wanting him to give her some cookies I guess . and it is turning it over . I do not know whether he got hurt or not . probably did . because his mom is right behind him and maybe she could have caught him . and the mother is washing the dishes but she let the water go so fast and so full that it is all the way down . and she will hafta clean it all up . she will hafta get the little kids out so she can . yeah .,1
"the stool is tilting . lid is off of the cookie jar . cookie in the left arm of the boy . his right hand is touching a cookie in the cookie jar . one of his feet is about a third off of the stool . he is got short pants and a blouse . and look like they are boots instead of shoes . the girl has a finger to her lips as though to say quiet one hand out . her left hand is out . she is got short skirt and a blouse , jersey sweater . socks , anklets rather . I did mention that the stool was tilting . the boys standing on the stool and it is tilting . I think I mentioned that . the girl has hair hanging to her neck . the boy has like hair combed straight back . the jar is open on the cupboard . the mothers drying the dish with her right hand holding it with her left . she is got an apron over her dress or whatever it may be . water spilling out of the sink . two cups facing opposite direction . one plate to the right of the cups . curtains flowing in the breeze of the wind . there still some more but  ... oh yeah .",1

I guess you can call that action . leaves are probably blowing . the mothers in her own little world . the waters still running . cookie jar . he is handing them out like he made them . the stool falling over or the stool . I think . and I think the little kid kicked it . and it pushed him over . instead of holding him up she gave him a shove .,1

"alright .

alright a little boy has a cookie jar . okay he is got on the ladder and trying to get a jar . and this is the mother I guess . right ? she is so  ... she really is not any good sense of a mother because the waters running out of the sink to the floor . so if I was a mother I would spank her . right ?,1

I do not think so .,1
hm  ... it is a little boy climbing up getting some cookies out of the cookie jar . and his little sister reaching for some . and the little boy is standing on a stool . and his big sister washing the dishes at the sink . big sister washing the dishes and then she got dishes sitting on the sink . and I think she is running water . and I said Johnny he is up on the ladder getting some cookies and the little sister reaching up after some . he is passing it down to her . and the stool about to turn over . the cups maybe she going to wash them and she got them sitting on the sink . and maybe running water on the sink and if she got a curtain to pull that she might get some light in there . since the dishes stacked up . they might be on the sink . no that be about all .,1
woman doing dishes . boy climbing up to get some cookies . well girl waiting to get some of the cookies . stool is falling over with the boy . the waters dripping out on the floor . I guess that is it .,1
"the poor moms getting her feet wet because she thinking of days gone by and then the water run . and that boy whether he knows or not he is gonna crack his head on the back of that counter trying to get too many cookies out . I do not know the significance of that little girl putting her hand to her mouth reaching . unless that is the way all silly girls act at that age . pardon ? oh sure . there is no handles on the cabinet drawers under the counter on the left side . and over in the window you see through the kitchen window all the styles are not in the glass . and if the kitchen windows the same type of window as well the other part of the house the styles only in the upper and the laterals . maybe they build them that way . no , but I did notice that is a little I would not say unusual but . pardon ? I said that the sink was overflowing . the mothers getting her feet wet . the boys going to fall very hard and hurt himself . and nobodys gonna help him . well happening  ... did I say the cabinet doors where the kids are have no handles on them ? oh â€¡ there is got to be a dozen other things . responsible ? well I will tell you the way mom is looking there is not much going on in her head . she is thinking of dad . and the little girl is saying  ""/. sh@o do not tell mom . the conflicts in what she is thinking whereas she did not know the kids are behind her . and did I say  ..? . the cabinet doors are different sizes . have no handles . I guess you take a big sledge hammer to that .",1
movement of any kind or whatever ? well he is reaching for the cookie but he is handing the cookie to her . in the meantime the stool is falling over . and she is drying dishes and the sink is running over and all that kind of stuff . . the little girl she is motioning for a cookie I guess . that is all I see . . I do not see . he is flying on his can . I can see that .,1
well this ones trying to touch her nose with her finger . is not that what she is doing ? well he is giving her a cookie out of the  ... the stool falling out under him . she is drying dishes . and the waters running out on the floor from the spigot . he is got a cookie out of the jar I guess . she is drying dishes and the waters running out on the floor . the spigots on . he is gonna fall .

well this lady is washing a lot of stuff . but the water is going down here . instead of its going down in there it is coming out . and the boy is getting the cookies . and the girl is wanting the cookies . and the way he is putting it on there he is gonna fall . yeah because that is crooked .

I do not quite get that but then  ... she has water on the floor and basically it is kind of a distressing scene . everythings going haywire . she needs to turn off the water . if she turned off the water she would be a hundred percent better off .,1
first of all I see I guess she is mother at the sink washing dishes and the water is overflowing from the sink on to the floor and she is standing in a puddle of water . and at the same time there is a daughter I guess a little girl has her hand up and also one finger to tell I guess her brother to do it quietly . and she is reaching up for a cookie he is taking out of a cookie jar . and as he is doing that the stool is falling over . that is it .,1
"is it alright to say mother and son and daughter ? mother is wiping dishes but she is overflowing the sink bowl . water is running on the floor . outside I cannot tell if it is a cloudy day or a great day but you can see some shrubbery and bushes . and the tilting stool is about to fall . taking cookies for he and his sister out of the cookie jar . so somebodys gonna have some cleanup work to do . and the daughter of course reaching her left arm and hand and elbow up to receive a cookie . but he is gonna go crashing on down the floor where the water is going , the suds water . I do the dishes sometimes at home . but with the dishwasher it is just pots and pans . fry pans , do our eggs in the morning .

I do not know which way it is for the little girl . because she is smiling . I think if she saw him falling over she would do something to help him so he would not get hurt . I mean she would grab it or something . but she is just looking up at him you know looking up at those good cookies and waiting for them to come to her hand . but this little finger in her mouth is  ...
