well the waters running over out of the sink . and the little boy is stealing a cookie . and he is about to fall off the stool . and the girl has her hand up to her mouth so she did not want the mother to know what they were up to . and the windows open . and it must be nice weather because the grass is pretty high and needs cut . and the mother is daydreaming or she would see that the water was going on the floor and she is gonna get wet or is wet . and the curtains seem to blowing brisk in the breeze .,0
"okay the little boy is on a stool about to fall . the stool about to upset . and he has a cookie in each hand , about to hand one cookie to the little girl who is standing there with her hand reached up for the cookie . and the water is running over into the sink . and the lady is standing there drying a dish . two cups and a plate are on the counter there . and out the window there is a walk way and you can see a window across from the walk way drapes . what is happening you said , huh ? okay that is what is happening I guess . thank  /.",0

I think that is about it . the mothers her drying the dishes . did I say that before ? the water is running over . and that is about it .,0
things that are happening . girls reaching for a cookie . the boy is reaching a cookie to the girl and also reaching at the cookie jar and he is gonna fall off a stool . the woman is drying dishes and washing dishes . and she is let the water from the sink pour out on the floor .

there is the action . there is the action as opposed to state  ... yeah action alright . alright . the girl is holding her finger up to her face . is it that kind of thing ? alright reaching out her hand for a cookie . her brother has one cookie near her hand . in his right hand he is reaching in the cookie jar . the stool is falling over . he has his . alright . the woman is wiping the dishes . she is holding plate in one hand and drying with the other . waters spilling out of the sink . and the waters running out of the faucet filling the sink . looks as if maybe there is a breeze blowing in the curtain . yes there is a breeze blowing in the curtains . the woman is smiling . they are all smiling . each one is looking at . at the other person  ... the water is splash .  ... okay ?,0
well the children are climbing up and he is about to fall . and he is getting cookies . and she is telling him to sh@o be quiet so mother will not hear him getting up there . and he is handing a cookie down to her . she is washing the dishes . and for some reason she must have been upset about something because she is letting the water run out all over the place . I cannot believe she is upset about the kids because she has not seen them . maybe she did turn and look at them and then go back to the dishes . in other words it is  ... she is deciding that if she did see them she is deciding that she is going to let them go ahead with it . but I do not think she would have let them go ahead if she saw the little boy falling . I think she would have turned . maybe dropped her dish . but she would have gotten hold of him and saved him from being harmed in the fall . and he might just pull all the cookie jar with him when he falls too . and with the water on the floor and the cookie jar on the floor it would be a sad  /. threesome and the kitchen would be a mess .,1
well he is stealing a cookie . and the stool tipping . and the sinks running over . she is standing in water for one thing . and there is a path out there in the yard . may be a cookie jar and him getting a cookie and the stool upsetting . a sink running over . she is standing in the water in the path . that looks like the roof of the house here .
